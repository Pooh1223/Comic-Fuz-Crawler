It's a program helps you download your manga megazines on https://comic-fuz.com/

## Preface

Since I am new to Python , I believe there are many parts in my code that can be improve.

Also, since it is originally a program helps only me to download megazines.

It might not be very useful to others except you're using the same monthly plan as I do.

I think the UI is clear enough for one to figure out how to use.

I will try to add more features to make it become a more useful program.

For now, it can help few people only.

## How to use

### 1. cd to the project directory using cmd or bash or whatever
